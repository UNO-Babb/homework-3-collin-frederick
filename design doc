Dots and Boxes - Design Document
CIST 1600 - Homework 3


What is the objective of the game?
* Players take turns drawing lines between dots to complete boxes.
* If a player completes a box, they claim it and get another turn.
* The player with the most boxes at the end wins.

How are player turns handled?
* Player 1 and Player 2 alternate turns unless a box is completed.
* Completing a box allows the player to go again.
* The current player is tracked and displayed on screen.

How is score displayed?
* A scoreboard is visible showing Player 1 vs Player 2.
* The score increases when a box is claimed.
* Boxes show a letter (A or B) and color fill to indicate ownership.

How are colors handled?
* Each player selects their own color at the beginning of the game.
* Lines drawn and boxes claimed will use the selected color.

What elements are on the board?
* Dots: 7x7 grid of static black dots.
* Lines: Horizontal and vertical segments between dots (clickable).
* Boxes: The area between every 4 adjacent dots that can be claimed.

Game Layout:
* A 7x7 dot grid is shown (which makes 6x6 = 36 boxes).
* UI includes player name input, color pickers, start button.
* Below the board, the current score and player turn is displayed.
* At the end of the game, a winner message and "Play Again" button appears.
